      "description": "Batman: Arkham Knight is the final instalment for the Arkham series by now. Joining forces with Bruce Wayne for the last time, we have to oppose Scarecrow and other iconic villains such as The Riddler, Harleen Quinzel a.k.a. Harley Quinn, Penguin and others.\n\nThe story continued after events in Arkham City when Joker died due to infection in his blood. Now, Scarecrow tries to release a new fear toxin, meanwhile new mysterious Arkham Knight plots against Batman as well. Still having consequences after being poisoned by the Joker and seeing visions with him, Bruce has to prevail the death of Gotham City.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics stays the same to the Arkham series. Melee combat system, use of the detective skills to find clues and gadgets still play a major role in Batman's fight against evil. Although now you can travel around not only by your grappling hook but a legendary Batmobile as well. Iconic voices of the characters, Kevin Conroy and Mark Hammil once again return to give their voices for the last game in Arkham series.",

      "description": "This game is often called an \"interactive film\" - because the proportion between the given story and the possibilities to influence the story is indeed somewhat different than in most games. The game develops between three points in the biography of the girl Jodie Holmes. In these three points, we find ourselves repeatedly. And in general, we see 16 years of her life, from 8 to 24 years.\nJodie from birth has a gift of communication with a disembodied being called Aiden. In this context, the Jodie-Aiden couple can capture people's consciousness, move objects, and even strangle people. At the same time, Jodie is periodically exposed to attacks of vague energies.\nHer parents are not her relatives, they give her to psychiatrists and refuse her. When the family of one of the psychiatrists perishes, Jodie, with the help of Ayden, establishes a connection with the deceased, she can let the living and the dead speak.\nThe CIA is interested in Jodie's abilities and makes her become an agent. She then instructs her on several missions, but Jodie realises that she is being used for criminal activities - and refuses to cooperate with the CIA. CIA agents do not leave her alone, and she destroys them.\nThe game has a lot of interpretations of what is happening in the world of the dead, different people use Jodi's forces in different ways. Jody herself also does not have a clear picture, she seeks and finds real parents, helps different people - but they rarely pay her the same.",

The story follows the survivors of a zombie virus outbreak in the fictional Raccoon City. There are two protagonists: Claire Redfield, a high school student, and Leon Kennedy, a policeman. They both search for the ways to escape the infested city. Companions, such as Ada Wong and Sherry, occasionally follow the protagonists. The characters eventually uncover the dark secrets of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus as a biological weapon, and fight its monsters, such as the Tyrant.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls either Leon or Claire from the third person view in a 3D environment. The two protagonists' storylines are intertwined. The player can complete the scenario playing one of the protagonists, and then replay it from the other character's POV, with all his previous actions taken into account. The game combines puzzle solving with zombie fights. Both protagonists use firearms as their main weapon; however, ammo is scarce.\n\n###Changes from the original\nBesides the updated graphics, the remake features a new camera and controls. In the original game, the controls were relative to the position of the player's character rather than the camera. The remake uses an over the shoulder camera, and the movements are relative to its angle. There's also no more loading screens, and the characters move between locations seamlessly.",

For 13 long years, Resident Evil series were rejecting the survival-horror aspect and atmosphere of first original games in the series mainly released in nineties on PlayStation one system. From the famous Resident Evil 4 until Resident Evil 6, the series went full-force into action genre leaving horror elements behind and hard-core fans disappointed. Finally, Capcom realized that Resident Evil needs a change and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard delivers those changes at its fullest. First of all, the camera angle changed from over the shoulder view into first-person mode. Another change is that survival-horror elements are back together with light puzzle solving, inventory management and maze-like mansion in which the main story of the game happens. The player controls Ethan Winters who is searching for his lost wife in a dark mansion filled with horrible creatures and insane family. \r\nResident Evil 7: Biohazard can also be played with virtual reality setup and it’s known as one of the best games which supports VR.",

While in captivity, the boy’s first task is to befriends his cellmate, a fantasy creature named Trico, who is a gigantic half-bird, half-cat hybrid that slightly reminds a hippogriff. Trico is the second main character and the mascot of The Last Guardian; the creature’s animation is incredibly detailed, and its behavior is modeled after real animals. The two form an unlikely symbiosis. The boy needs the creature’s strength and ability to fly to overcome obstacles and fend off guards who try to bring the characters back to their cells. Trico, in turn, needs the boy’s wits and agility to sneak, solve puzzles, feed the creature and heal its wounds. The player only controls the boy, while Trico needs to be manipulated into performing certain actions.

She suffers from a growing psychosis after her lover Dillion was brutally murdered by Vikings. Carrying his severed head, Senua sets out to Helheim, the underworld of the dead, to bring her lover's soul back. Her grim and bloody journey mirrors her descent into madness. It becomes increasingly difficult for her (and, thus, the player) to tell fact from fantasy, as she hears voices in her head and sees hallucinations. \r\n\r\nWhen not fighting her enemies, Senua has to solve puzzles to move forward. This is where her distorted perception actually comes out handy, enabling her to \"focus\" and see what regular people can not. The ghostly voices, recorded using the binaural method to create an eery effect, also help to guide Senua or to warn her about dangers. All of Senua movements, expressions and reactions were recorded through motion capture to make them more realistic and emotional.",

The main character wears a magical scarf, which allows flying for some time, and recharges it with gathered cloth or simply by walking. From time to time the protagonist finds collectible items and discover ruins that can give additional information about the world or the storyline. The only way of interaction with in-game objects is a shout. \n\nThe game transfers the atmosphere of an absolute loneliness. However, during the journey the character can meet other players controlling differently dressed, but generally the same figures. Wandering together can be helpful for both players, as they are able to charge one another’s scarves. The thing is that both players cannot communicate each other in any way, except producing noises. Together players can complete levels and continue moving to their final destination.",

Hostile environments and one-hit deaths may seem difficult, but the game implements a fair amount of checkpoints. The monochrome color palette showcases cartoony proportions of every living thing while making lack of details threatening. Limbo shows you exactly what you encounter, but never how it looks.\n\nLimbo uses the atmosphere and sound design of the horror genre while avoiding tropes of the modern horror games. The overarching theme and unique style compensated for the rather short game with an abrupt ending, making Limbo one of the most impactful games for the genre.\n\nThe simple controls and easy-to-pick-up mechanics help to make a clear distinction, which part of the stage players can interact with, and which part can lead to the quick death. Even though the game is in black and white, this separation is intuitive and natural, so the player would know exactly where to go or what to do.",

She or he bears the surname Ryder and has a twin - whatever gender you choose, it will be the opposite. Ryders traveled billions of miles from our Milky Way galaxy on the space ark Nexus. The ship is carrying thousands of passengers in suspended animation, and the Pathfinders’goal is to find them a habitable planet to call home. \nAndromeda is heavy on the plot, there are many dialogues and cutscenes that may make you feel like watching a movie. The dialogue options usually define how your character is perceived by the others rather than actual plot forks. The action is played like a third-person shooter, allowing you to aim and take cover. Enemy AI reactions will vary, forcing you to employ flexible tactics.

It was inspired by supernatural thrillers like Twin Peaks and X-Files.\n\n###Plot\nAs its name suggests, the game is set in Virginia, in a fictional country town called Kingdom. A small boy named Lucas Fairfax disappeared recently. The main protagonist, a young and inexperienced FBI agent Anne Tarver, has to uncover the mystery and find the child. Since she lacks the necessary experience, Tarver is accompanied by a higher ranking agent Maria Halperin. The two don't trust each other, but they have to overcome their differences and work together.\n\n###Gameplay\nVirginia's gameplay is similar to interactive movies and \"walking simulators.\" The player controls Anne and travels around the city, accompanied by Halperin, to find clues and learn more about what's going on in the city. The player has no actual control over the actions of the protagonist. Instead, he or she can only navigate Tarver over the city and then watch her act. The game is very short, and two hours is usually enough to complete it.\n\n###Style\nThe game is made in an intentionally low-poly visual style. There are no dialogues, neither in subtitles nor voice acting.

Uncover the traces of the vanished community; discover fragments of events and memories to piece together the mystery of the apocalypse.\r\nFeaturing a beautiful, detailed open-world and a haunting soundtrack, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture is non-linear storytelling at its best.",

      "description": "Final Fantasy IX (ファイナルファンタジーIX, Fainaru Fantajī Nain) is a 2000 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation video game console. It is the ninth title in the main Final Fantasy series and the last to debut on the original PlayStation. The game plot centers on the consequences of a war between nations in a medieval fantasy world called Gaia. Players follow bandit Zidane Tribal, who kidnaps Alexandrian princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII as part of a gambit by the neighboring nation of Lindblum. He joins Garnet and a growing cast of characters on a quest to take down her mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria, who started the war. The plot shifts when the player learns that Brahne is a pawn of a more menacing threat, Kuja, who shares a mysterious history with Zidane spanning two worlds.\nThe game was developed alongside Final Fantasy VIII. Envisioned by developers as a retrospective for the series, it departed from the futuristic settings of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII by returning to the medieval style of the first six installments. Consequently, it was influenced heavily by the original Final Fantasy game, and features allusions to the rest of the titles. Despite this approach, the game did introduce new features to the series, such as \"Active Time Event\" cutscenes, \"Mognet\", and unique equipment and skill systems.\nFinal Fantasy IX was released to critical acclaim. It is often cited by critics and fans as one of the best Final Fantasy titles, and holds the highest Metacritic score of the series. Final Fantasy IX was commercially successful, selling more than 5 million copies worldwide by March 2003 and 5.5 million copies by February 2016. It was re-released in 2010 as a PSOne Classic on the PlayStation Store; this version was compatible with PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation Vita support arrived in 2012. In 2016, ports featuring minor gameplay and graphical enhancements were released for iOS, Android and Microsoft Windows followed by a port for PlayStation 4 in 2017.",

According to the storyline, right after the appointment to the fire tower in Shoshone forest Henry starts facing strange things.

A virus attack led to a machine uprising, and Mighty No. 9 is among the few robots that were not infected. His creator, Dr. White, sends him to stop his rampaging kin and find out who is behind the attack. The Xel technology allows Beck to bring his fellow Numbers back to reason. He will also assimilate their data to send it back to the lab so that Dr. White could find the cure for the virus. Beck is occasionally assisted by Call, a female robot unaffected by the virus.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls Beck in a 2D environment. Like in Mega Man, the protagonist jumps platforms and fires a gun. Beck can also use the special acceleration ability that allows him to leap long distances and through his enemies. By leaping through injured opponents, Beck can assimilate their Xel to receive a temporary power-up. The type of a power-up depends on the color of a Xel: red gives Beck more powerful attacks, green speeds him up, yellow improves his stamina, and blue heals him. Gathering Xel from Mighty Numbers, Beck receives new special abilities.\n\n###Multiplayer\nThe game includes a cooperative multiplayer for two, in which the second player controls Call. Her gameplay is very different and is largely defensive as she uses deflector shields to protect herself and Beck.",

      "description": "###Dead or alive\nA game of insane complexity in the best traditions of the Dark Souls series, the games of which set the standard of quality in the genre. The game was developed by the Japanese studio Team Ninja for the Sony PlayStation 4 console and PC in 2017. The development team previously released projects such as Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive. The version of the game for the PC contains all the additional content that came out on the console.\n\n###The setting\nThe game takes place in the seventeenth century Japan, in the fictionalized version of the Sengoku period, when the country was engulfed in the flames of civil war. The player takes control of the An Anglo-Irish sailor named William, who sets out in pursuit of the villain in the country of the rising sun and finds himself entangled in the mystical and political upheavals that pervaded all of Japan. Despite the fantasy elements, the plot uses real prototypes of historical events and personalities.\n\n###Key features\nThe controls are quite simple: two types of attack, block and dodge are available. The gameplay is modified by role-playing elements: for example, at the start of the game, it is necessary to choose which weapon in William will be predefined. This helps to determine which skills to develop, with further completion. Like Dark Souls, enemies are reborn after each interaction with the local analog of bonfires - Shrines.",

Most importantly, the robotic assistants called ROMs became increasingly popular and largely replaced the regular phones. The main producer of the robots is a corporation called Parallax, and it plans to create a new kind of fully independent AI. There's a rebel party called Human Revolution that aims to stop the progress of the AI.\n\n###Plot\nThe main engineer of Parallax, Hayden Webber, recently was abducted. The main protagonist is a journalist who researches the Webber's disappearance. He or she is accompanied by Turing, a highly advanced robotic assistant. They go on a search in the fictional city of Neo-San Francisco on the eve of Christmas.\n\n###Gameplay\n2064: Read Only Memories works as a point-and-click adventure game with a static first-person view. The environment and characters are presented to the player as slightly animated images. He or she can interact with them by clicking and choosing options, such as to look at, to take, or to speak to. \n\n###Style\nThe game is made in the vein of the 1980s and 1990s graphic adventure games. It uses pixel art visual style with minimal animation and neon-lighted environments, accompanied by a synthwave music score.",

      "description": "Pindorama é como os povos indígenas chamavam a terra que hoje conhecemos como Brasil, e a ideia desse jogo é abordar temas, culturas e povos reais da época antes do descobrimento do Brasil, bem como temas, culturas e povos fictícios.\nPara criar o jogo, eu me inspirei em Super Mario 64, Fire Emblem e The Lost Vikings, três jogos que aparentemente não têm muitas semelhanças (e não tem mesmo), mas que possuem ideias, conceitos e mecânicas muito interessantes. Pegando um pedacinho de cada um e fazendo uma mistura nada habitual, criei o protótipo de Estrela Solitária.\nA história do jogo se passa séculos depois de um grande evento que destruiu quase tudo o que existia no mundo de Pindorama. Muitas pessoas morreram e muito do conhecimento foi perdido. Agora, grupos de jovens exploradores se juntam e formam clãs para encontrarem artefatos do passado, recuperando assim parte do conhecimento perdido, além de aprenderem mais sobre a própria história do mundo. No meio disso tudo, surge uma lenda sobre um poderoso artefato chamado de Estrela Solitária, que supostamente seria capaz de dar ao seu portador todo o poder e conhecimento acumulado entre as duas principais tribos que habitam Pindorama. Apesar de muitos duvidarem da existência desse artefato, ele se tornou objeto de desejo de muitos exploradores, que dedicam a vida para encontrá-lo.\nA jogabilidade consiste em procurar artefatos perdidos em 8 áreas diferentes, e para isso você pode recrutar vários exploradores diferentes, cada qual com sua própria habilidade. Essas habilidades são necessárias para alcançar certas lugares das áreas a serem exploradas, por isso é muito comum voltar em locais já visitados quando você tiver um novo integrante no seu clã. Outro destaque da jogabilidade fica por conta do sistema de batalha, que é extremamente simples e automático, bem diferente daquilo que costumamos ver em jogos feitos no RPG Maker.\nOBSERVAÇÃO IMPORTANTE:\nO jogo ainda é apenas um protótipo, pois tudo foi feito em uma única semana, para participar de uma JAM, por isso apenas dois baús estão disponíveis para serem encontrados.",

      "description": "As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!\nDinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!\nYou must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!\nBy chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\nPick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!\nBy bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.\nCreate a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!\nAll items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new \"Engrams\" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D \"Explorer Notes\". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!\nEverything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!\nThe mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.\nOn the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.\nYou can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!\nThe over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) & true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

The game also features land missions and side quests that allow you to upgrade your character and get additional bonuses.

      "description": "Battlefield V is the sixteenth game in its franchise. \r\n\r\n###Plot\r\nLike the original Battlefield, the game is based on the real events of World War II. The game focuses on the obscure battles of the war. It features storylines that tie the battles together and consist of episodes called “war stories”.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nBattlefield V puts a strong emphasis on realism. The game avoids video game abstractions in favor of immersive experience of the war. For that goal, the game aims to increase the player's interaction with the environment, such as doors, vehicles, or ammo. The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach.\r\nThe game gives a spotlight to women in the military who are among the main characters in the campaign. The player might also choose to play a female character in the multiplayer, as the gender is not tied to a class. The game also allows the players many customization options for costumes, vehicles, and weapons.\r\n\r\n###Modes\r\nBattlefield V has many multiplayer modes, some of which are new to the series and some are reimagined versions of the modes from previous games. For example, The Grand Operations mode is based on the original Battlefield mode called Operations. This mode imitates a military campaign and consists of a series of battles with different objectives and non-linear progress options.",

Another difference is multiplayer, which comes in two kinds: you can summon other players into your game and fight bosses side by side or you can fight impostors, who are other players invading your playthrough.\n\nThroughout the game, you are forced to explore an enormous open world of Yharnam, which looks like alternate universe Lovecraft-inspired Victorian-era England, as The Hunter. You meet horrific bosses, explore vast areas, houses and open spaces while continually dodging, attacking and trying not to get killed by a massive number of hostile NPCs.",

The character's goal is to find a way to defeat the monster. \n\n###Gameplay\nIn the prologue, the player controls the pregnant woman in the real world.

Most of the game consists of the protagonist navigating the world, jumping platforms, walking tightropes and climbing, with few occasional fights. An Edge Guard system ensures that the protagonist cannot fall from most platforms. At the few selected locations, the protagonist can fall to her death and respawn.\n\n###Style\nBound features a notably colorful and surreal visual style. The environment around the protagonist consists of geometric shapes that change in constant motion. Locations often reflect certain aspects in the life of the frame story protagonist.

Therefore, within the game players are able to assume roles of city’s principal architect and mayor.

Players have to zone the city, build roads, explore the surroundings, provide infrastructure and jobs to attract new citizens. Once the newcomers settle down, the immediate reaction is expected to establish public services and to set proper taxes. Progressing within the game and developing the city will unlock new upgrades of the urban environment and lead to the territorial expansion. The gameplay also requires the control of several city’s parameter scales like budget, health, employment, and pollution.

      "description": "Darksiders III is the third installment in its series of dark fantasy action games. Plotwise, it is the series' spin-off rather than the sequel.\n\n###Plot\nThe game is set in the world after the literal Biblical Apocalypse that involved the Four Horsemen and a battle between angels and demons. The story of Darksiders III unfolds at the background of the events of two original games. Darksiders III follows Fury, a Horsewoman of the Apocalypse and the sister to the original protagonist, War the Horseman. She goes on a quest given to her by the Charred Council, an institution that is meant to keep the balance between Heaven, Hell, and Earth. Fury's mission is to find and annihilate the infamous Seven Deadly Sins. The mighty Lord of the Hollows agrees to help her, although he's obviously pursuing his own goals. He gives Fury the power of the flame.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls Fury from the third person view in an open world. She can use a variety of weapons, including a whip, a sword, and a dagger, as well as her magical abilities. She can also shape-shift into several forms based on elements, such as the flame. Fury also has to solve puzzles and jump platforms. The game reintroduces some of the enemies from the previous parts and introduces new monsters. The enemies in Darksiders III are less numerous but stronger and tougher, taking more effort to beat them.",

      "description": "Fallout 76 is a multiplayer-only game set in the universe of Fallout series. It is the first MMO game in the Fallout franchise and ninth installment overall. It is also the earliest game in the Fallout universe inner chronology, thus serving as a prequel to the whole series.\r\n\r\n###Setting\r\nThe game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, a quarter century after a nuclear holocaust that turned most of the US into a radioactive wasteland. The players assume the roles of the various dwellers of Vault 76, presumably the first Vault-Tec bunker to release its inhabitants. Their goal is to reclaim the world. The vault is located in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia. Fallout 76 offers an open world with many locations based on real West Virginia places. Some of the new monsters are also based on the local folklore.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nUnlike all previous games in its series, Fallout 76 features no human NPCs (although robots and monsters are present). Instead, the game delivers the story through records and environment. Some of Fallout series famous mechanics return in Fallout 76. The character creation is based on a modified version of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of abilities and perks. V.A.T.S. targeting system also appears, albeit this time it works in real-time. The game allows the players to build homes and establish settlements in any part of the map. There are also nuclear missiles that allow the players to annihilate each other's settlements.",

In order to proceed from one level to another, you have to collect cubes or fragments of it. However, by rotating the world, you can actually gain access to some places that wouldn't be available without this mechanic. \n\nGomez, our protagonist, must restore the order in his universe by passing through the levels and collecting little fragments of it. But he will face no threat at all. Your only challenge is to actually beat these quite peculiar puzzles, basically without any guidelines at all.

      "description": "First Class Trouble is an asymmetrical third person multiplayer co-operative game, about trust and deceit.\nWith First Class Trouble we want to invoke a super strong social experience, filled with trust and deception. Players are working together, but a few players are not who they seem and are actively working against you. With First Class Trouble we want to create situations where you can never fully trust your companions, but you will have to trust someone in order to progress through the game. This means that you constantly have to look over your shoulder, uncover information on players and in the end, you will have to figure out who the Synth players are to win the game. We aim to create a rich playground of possibilities fueled by social interactions with other players. This will result in a new player experience each time you press “find a game”.\nThe plot\nWe are on board the Alithea, a massive 2 km long space cruise ship, set for Proxima Centauri. Owned by the prominent Scandinavian Infinity Cruises, it is the most prestigious space project ever undertaken; a merger of wealth, power, and business in a newly technological world gone wild. Packed with all the latest tech, Alithea is also equipped with the latest in AI servants - Personoids. There had been some problem with maintaining the Personoids emotional state, but it had been solved before departure. The solutions were simply to reboot all the synths every 24 hours. But something failed – of course. Someone, or rather something in the system, didn’t reboot. Things spiraled out of control aboard the Alithea. Now it’s passing Jupiter at 1/8 the speed of light, with a robot rebellion. C.A.I.N. has already tried to eliminate all the passengers by turning the oxygen off, and only a couple of travelers with Oxygen Rebreathers are left - trying to escape. Luckily the Personoids, were purposely designed to be weaker than humans - because they are searching the ship for the last remaining humans. Hiding among them. Ready to finally ‘reset’ them for once.\nFirst Class Trouble varies from other titles with its engaging mix of cooperation and deception, using an in-depth proximity-based voice system, where players can communicate only when close to each other. It is through these close social interactions that intense and fun situations will arise.",

The game mixes the element of fighting and hacks and slashes with a heavy focus on multiplayer. \r\n\r\n###Plot and setting \r\nThe game takes place in the medieval fantasy world and follows the conflict between three factions: the Iron Legion, the Chosen, and the Warborn. Each fraction represents a specific medieval culture: knights, samurai, and Vikings respectively. \r\n\r\n###Gameplay \r\nThe gameplay incorporates elements of the hack-and-slash and fighting game. The player can choose from more than 12 different characters from each of the fractions. The all have their unique moves, weapons, characteristics, abilities, and executions. The fighting system is based on the duel between players. It incorporates the variety of moves such as attacks from different angles, blocks, dodges, stuns, counterattacks, unblockable attacks, and faints. \r\nEach character has its progression system which allows one to gain new perks, upgrade weapons, armor as well as the increase in rank that affects matchmaking process. \r\nThere are six multiplayer modes: they primarily differ from each other by the number of the players involved in the conflict. The multiplayer modes do not feature any PvE battles — the leftovers are team elimination, flag capture and one on one battles.",

      "description": "Gameplay\nFriday the 13th: The Game is a third-person horror, survival game where players take on the role of a teen counselor, or for the first time ever, Jason Voorhees. You and six other unlucky souls will do everything possible to escape and survive while the most well-known killer in the world tracks you down and brutally slaughters you.  Friday the 13th: The Game will strive to give every single player the tools to survive, escape or even try to take down the man who cannot be killed. Each and every gameplay session will give you an entirely new chance to prove if you have what it takes not only to survive, but to best the most prolific killer in cinema history, a slasher with more kills than any of his rivals!\nMeanwhile, Jason will be given an array of abilities to track, hunt and kill his prey. Stalk from the shadows, scare your targets and kill them when the time is right in as brutal a fashion as you can imagine. Take control of the legendary killer that is Jason Voorhees and terrify those unfortunate enough to cross your path!\nPlay as Jason Voorhees!\nFor the first time ever, you will have the opportunity to play as Jason Voorhees, the most famous killer in horror. Stalk your prey, ambush them whenever you see fit and strike fear in the hearts of so many hapless victims as you become the legend himself! Friday the 13th: The Game will include a variety of kills, new and familiar, that will help you set the tone for the Jason Voorhees that you want to be. You’ll even get to unlock various Jason incarnations from the movies!\nJason will be equipped with a terrifying array of abilities, giving you the control of a hunter at the height of his game. These are his woods, and he knows them all too well. Jason will not only feed off the fear of his victims, but will become stronger as the night progresses. The darker the night, the more terrifying Jason becomes!\nFans of the movies will be able to play as various versions of Jason, including:\nFriday the 13th, Part II\nFriday the 13th, Part III\nFriday the 13th, Part VI: Jason Lives\nFriday the 13th, Part VII: New Blood\nFriday the 13th, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan\nJason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday\nHow Will You Survive?\nThe entire focus of Friday the 13th: The Game is multiplayer. Survival is entirely up to you, the player, as you either stealthily hide from Jason or work together as a team to escape or bring the fight to Jason. Playing as a counselor is all about risk and reward, giving players multiple means of triumph over Jason! Want to hide in the woods as you wait for the police? Perhaps you want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless opportunities to survive the night, but every choice has a consequence.\nFriday the 13th: The Game will continually set the pace of change, giving you unfamiliar surroundings while Jason Voorhees looks for his latest victim. No single strategy will ever be reliable, forcing players to adapt and change each time they begin their long night in Camp Blood! Be wary, you never know when or where Jason is going to strike!\nPlay as the Counselors!\nWe all remember the various tropes from Friday the 13th, and the game will be no exception! Each counselor type will have strengths and weaknesses, affording players the chance to excel in certain situations. Find the counselor that best suits your play style, or come up with various strategies to win against Jason! Players will have the chance to continually update and improve their characters through unlocks, customization and improvement! The more you play, the more you adapt and become a better all-around counselor!\nCamp Crystal Lake in All Its Glory!\nMirroring Camp Crystal Lake from the Friday the 13th series, players will try to survive not only in the iconic Camp Crystal Lake, but surrounding area. Iconic locations from the movies, like Higgins Haven will also serve as stalking grounds for Jason and his prey.\nPlayers will be given a large, open area in which to explore as they attempt to hide from certain death! Each gameplay session will fundamentally change the scenario, never affording players the opportunity to learn patterns or figure out where helpful items may be lying. With each movie giving a different feeling to the campgrounds, Friday the 13th: The Game gives you new and challenging situations every time you enter the woods!\nYour Crystal Lake Database\nFriday the 13th: The Game will feature a progressive unlock system unified to your account. The longer you play, the more you'll unlock from counselor customization to new Jason Voorhees costumes seen in the movies! Besides giving you personalized camp counselors, you'll be able to unlock secrets within Camp Crystal Lake, exploring the mystery surrounding Jason Voorhees and the grounds he patrols!\nBe Kind. Rewind.\nEvery aspect of Friday the 13th: The Game\nis drawn straight from movies you know and love. We’ve carefully crafted this world to remind you of\neverything you remember about Friday the 13th, right down to the visual fidelity of the 80’s. This is exactly how you remember it.",

Set in a 17th century setting embedded in magic, Greedfall has a unique visual identity inspired by European Baroque art, depicting grandiose sceneries in muted warm colors and dark undertones.\r\n\r\nExplore a fresh new world as – along with many other settlers, mercenaries and treasure hunters - you set foot on a remote island seeping with magic, rumored to be filled with riches and lost secrets. A grand journey filled with mystery follows, as you find yourself in the middle of ever-increasing tensions between the invading settlers and the locals, who are protected by manifestations of the island’s earthly magic in the form of supernatural beings.\r\n\r\nWith a strong focus on its core RPG identity, GreedFall follows Spider's experience in building intricate worlds filled with mysteries to discover, weaving deep character interactions, and offering players freedom to achieve quests and objectives in many different ways – through combat, as well as diplomacy, deception or stealth. The island of GreedFall is a living, ever-evolving world. Your actions, from seemingly trivial choices to the most important political decisions, will influence and alter its course, as well as the relationship between the different factions established on the island.",

Choose one of 14 playable roles within infantry, recon and armour unit types, each equipped with different weapons, vehicles and equipment.

Communication is essential. Players work together beneath the leadership of officers and their commander to take strategic targets on the battlefield and dominate the opposition. Hell Let Loose is a game that demands teamwork and communication not only to win, but to survive.\nUnique Meta game\nFight for victory by breaking through the enemy lines on a large, evolving battlefield.

Expect plot twists, irreverent humor, cameos and borderline trademark infringing scenarios as you complete the 50+ levels. With party mode you'll be able to compete for the highest score locally or against the community.\nGuided by narrator Mick “RicePirate” Lauer players will learn the ropes in a series of increasingly precarious and fantastical instructional lessons. These span everything from unloading cargo off moving planes to smuggling giraffes out of the zoo and transporting goods to strange locales like haunted houses and outer space.\nNo matter what the job entails, customers appreciate prompt delivery. So, whether on a heist or doing a repo job, load as much into the truck as possible before zooming off to the next gig. How freight gets from one place to another is entirely up to players, though, so toss the manual out the window and get creative. Break down the walls, throw things, and use technology like portals and ray guns across more than 50 levels. Anything goes, as long as the work gets done!\nEnjoy the game solo as an independent contractor or team up with a friend or loved one. Moving Out features both local and online play across its arcade, story, and versus modes. Each level also adjusts the experience dynamically to account for the number of players on screen, thereby welcoming Smooth Move employees of all ages and skill levels.\nMoving Out is currently in development as the premiere title from SMG’s Melbourne studio and is made in collaboration with Stockholm-based developer Devm Games.",

The game is set in a fictional city named Fortune Valley. The player can choose between the three individuals to represent. The title features a real car — a total of 74 ones, and crafting system — many car parts can be tuned according to the player's liking. \nThere is a total of five challenges types: Race, Drift, Off-Road, Drag, and Runner. All the modes share the goal — to reach the finish. However, the initial purpose is altered depending on the race — sometimes one has to drift his way to the finish line, somewhere the manual transmission turns one, and the gear switching comes to be mandatory.\n\n###Plot\nPayback is one of few NFS' to feature ongoing narrative — the story of this one emphasizes the revenge theme. Three characters — Tyler, Mac, and Jess — are trying to avenge Lina who betrayed the crew from the very start.  Each member of the gang has its unique abilities — Jess, for instance, is professional intel gatherer, so she plays a role of inside agent all the time. Guys, on the other hand, are more into races, so they do the dirty job in the trio.",

Needless to say, the public was excited to begin quantifying their everyday lives. The general term for this value, which determines the morality of an individual's heart and soul, is commonly known as the Psycho-Pass.\nOne component of this value is the Crime Coefficient, which is ultimately a number that represents an individual's potential to commit crime. In order to combat those who attempt to disrupt the status quo, detectives work in tandem to maintain peace and order, composed of Enforcers and Inspectors. The former is tasked with apprehending suspects, while the latter oversees and commands their subordinate colleagues. After all, Enforcers possess high Crime Coefficients. However, because of their criminal nature, they can better understand what makes other criminals tick, allowing them to sniff out suspects and arrest the true perpetrators. But because of their criminal background, Inspectors are needed to provide a calm and sound judgement to each case. Ultimately, all members of the MWPSB have to walk a fine line, maintaining their own mental health while facing the worst that society has to offer.\nWith justice in their hearts, the detectives of Division 1 tackle each case, confronting humanity's ugly truths.\nBut, what lies ahead?",

The battle begins with players making the leap out of the plane to spread out across the map and to gather all possible equipment required for survival. Then, after a while, game intelligence randomly sets a circle shape safe zone, which gamers must reach to stay alive, and marks it on the map. Gear and resources are scattered throughout the map, so players can grab everything they need while running to the zone. Therefore, the main action comes out of the players’ collision on their ways to the circle. You can join the fight either alone or in a team (up to 4 people). Due to the customization system, lots of clothing items and weapon skins could be both bought on the marketplace and found in crates. However, in-app purchases don’t actually affect the gameplay.",

The initial characters roster included 16 characters four of which were newcomers to the series. Since the game release, many more characters were added with DLC making roster more than twice as big as it was on launch. The core gameplay shares many similarities with Street Fighter IV. However, it abandons Focus Mode and Ultra Combos introduce in that game. The main new mechanic in Street Fighter V is V-Skills system. V-Skill is special moves, unique for every character.

So you progress through similar levels killing enemies and trying to figure out what's happening. \nBesides original time mechanics, the game makes you quite vulnerable: a single enemy shot kills you making start the level again. At the same time your weaponry is limited, so to survive you need to pick enemies' guns and ammo or use melee combat.

If any encounter with these foes proves fatal, Zimri’s consciousness is uploaded into a new host body, ready for the next attempt.\nAn ever-changing labyrinth\nThe colony starship has a self-configuring macrostructure which can alter its internal architecture – and due to the catastrophic malfunction, that’s exactly what will happen. Upon awakening in a new cloned body or on teleporting between decks, the layout of the starship will change each time. Each and every expedition into The Persistence will be unique, with different items and gear to collect & upgrade.\nEnhance, upgrade and augment\nThe technology of the 26th century allows for genetic augmentation and manipulation of dark matter technology. Resequence Zimri’s DNA to improve health, toughness and defensive abilities or even harvest crew DNA to create cloned bodies of crewmembers to inhabit, each with their own unique abilities.\nExplore, evade, fight and gather resources\nThe mutated horde won’t think twice about tearing Zimri limb from limb. Use the environment to scope out, stalk and gain the tactical advantage in either evading or attempting to take them down.  Explore the decks of the ship and gather resources, weapons and suit customizations to aid survival in the journey deeper into the dark and terrifying depths.\nAsymmetric Multiplayer\nConnect a phone or tablet running IOS or Android to the game for up to 2 players to take control of ‘Solex’ – the ship’s engineering system.

      "description": "Uncanny Valley is an indie horror game about insanity and supernatural.\n\n###Style and atmosphere\nUncanny Valley is made in the simple 2D pixel-art style with no face animations. Despite its limitations, the game recreates the gloomy atmosphere of supernatural thrillers like Silent Hill games and such TV series as Twin Peaks and Stranger Things. It is set in the cold, rainy area during autumn and winter. Uncanny Valley features dark, claustrophobic levels and is set to creepy horror synth / dark ambient music.\n\n###Plot\nThe plot of Uncanny Valley is nonlinear and strongly depends on the player's choices. The game itself recommends the player to replay it several times to discover all possible plotlines and endings.\n\nThe protagonist is Tom, a security guard at a secret facility. His only colleagues are Buck, an obese guard, and Eve, a young caretaker who is Tom's love interest. His mental health is far from perfect, as Tom suffers from narcolepsy. He often falls asleep and loses the edge between reality and fantasy. Some of the events in the game are actually the main character's illusions and dreams.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player leads Tom as he does his daily watchman's job. By night, he has to patrol the secret research facility, eventually learning its dark secrets. Occasionally, Tom will fall into his nightmares and have to run away from the shadowy enemies. Tom cannot sprint for too long before his stamina runs out. However, in Uncanny Valley, the protagonist cannot die and there are no Game Overs.",

It was inspired by supernatural thrillers like Twin Peaks and X-Files.\n\n###Plot\nAs its name suggests, the game is set in Virginia, in a fictional country town called Kingdom. A small boy named Lucas Fairfax disappeared recently. The main protagonist, a young and inexperienced FBI agent Anne Tarver, has to uncover the mystery and find the child. Since she lacks the necessary experience, Tarver is accompanied by a higher ranking agent Maria Halperin. The two don't trust each other, but they have to overcome their differences and work together.\n\n###Gameplay\nVirginia's gameplay is similar to interactive movies and \"walking simulators.\" The player controls Anne and travels around the city, accompanied by Halperin, to find clues and learn more about what's going on in the city. The player has no actual control over the actions of the protagonist. Instead, he or she can only navigate Tarver over the city and then watch her act. The game is very short, and two hours is usually enough to complete it.\n\n###Style\nThe game is made in an intentionally low-poly visual style. There are no dialogues, neither in subtitles nor voice acting. The player can only understand the narrative through the facial expressions and body language of the characters, as well as the other clues.",

It's the player's choice to navigate the world on foot or on a wide range of vehicles from cars to boats.\n\nIt is up to the player to choose whether to use a lethal or non-lethal approach on a mission as there is always a taser in your inventory and a billiard ball attached to a paracord that knocks enemies out. \n\nIt is possible to hack into any devices that are connected to ctOS.

      "description": "The game continues the previous game line: XCOM Enemy Unknown. In XCOM 2 we see the Earth under the rule of aliens. The order established by them is based on total control but is proclaimed as the realm of prosperity and security. However, on the periphery of large cities, there are those who consider it a dictatorship and are struggling to restore independence to people. Thus the new XCOM, the organisation of freedom fighters, is reborn. The base for the organisation's soldiers is now the alien ship \"The Avenger\", converted to the needs of the defenders of the Earth.\nThe player will have to travel around the global map, contact guerrillas in various places, look for resources and perform partisan attacks on the critical points of the enemies. The tactics of the organisation have changed - now they are in the minority. The factories for the production of weapons and other equipment were closed 20 years ago, so you have to collect any found equipment and resources.\nThe game introduced many new enemies, but there are aliens from the previous game too. The hero of the game has a unique ability to be in contact with the psi-network uniting all the aliens. This ability makes him a turning point in which the enslavement of the Earth can be reversed.",

This is the second title of a franchise, being preceded by Red Dead Revolver and followed by Red Dead Redemption 2 coming out in late 2018. \nWe play as John Marston who gradually takes down and take out criminals and those, who crosses his path. Among the combat mechanics, the most interesting one is \"Dead Eye\" — it allows one to point multiple targets out in slow motion and then shoot them simultaneously. \nThe game features 16-players multiplayer and cooperative and also has zombie DLC — Undead Nightmare. Additional content adds two modes to the original game: undead overrun in which you have to survive an infinite amount of zombie waves, and Land Grab in which player has to defend the particular piece of land to gain control of it.",

We knew it were lying and we did it anyway. We’ve carried that shame around with us for years, a burden weighing on every moment of every day.\nEnough is enough.\nIt’s time to fix this, to unburden our shame. Let us give you our shame, for you to carry it around instead. We’re sick of it.\nFrom the liars who brought you the award winning indie game The Stanley Parable comes The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe, an expansion to the original game with more content, more endings, more whimsical adventures of the two best friends Stanley and The Narrator. Coming to PC and consoles in 2019.\nTastefully seasoned with the bitter remorse of having deceived so many loyal fans for so long.\nBut seriously, this time it’s done. No more.",

It is considered one of the best beat 'em up series of all time. After many years, Axel and Blaze are finally picking up the fight where they left.\n\nFeaturing hand-drawn visuals from the team behind 2017’s gorgeous Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap remake, Streets of Rage 4 builds upon the classic trilogy’s gameplay with new mechanics, a fresh story and a gauntlet of dangerous stages with a serious crime problem. Streets of Rage 4 recalls classic gameplay but it stands as an entirely original arcade-style romp thanks to the expertise of Guard Crush Games and Dotemu.\n\nWhether players gang up with a friend or clean up the city solo, Streets of Rage 4 is a skull-bashing, chicken-chomping delight all set to a thumping soundtrack sure to get your blood pumping.",

For example, you can decide whether there will be a river nearby for fishing.\nThe farm area needs to be cleared, and it will take time.\nThe hero has many different activities: plant and care for plants, raise livestock, practice crafts, extract ore, and also enter into relationships with residents of the neighbouring town to earn game money. Relationships with characters include communication, performing tasks for money, exchanging, searching for fossils and even military actions and marrying. The character is limited by the reserve of strength and health - both parameters are visible on the screen, and the game automatically puts the hero to rest if the limit of his capabilities is close.

It is designed n the vein of classic 16-bit 2D platformers.\n\n###Plot\nLong ago, Dr. Wily, a would-be mad scientist, created a device called the Double Gear System that could increase the powers of robots by pushing them to the limit. The device was banned for being too dangerous for robots. This time, however, Dr. Wily decided to complete his creation and test it on the eight robots he stole from his former colleague, the wise Dr. Light. Using Double Gear, Dr. Wily creates Robot Masters of the stolen robots to help him to conquer the whole world. Mega Man, a good robot and the protagonist of the series, cannot defeat the stronger and faster Robot Masters. To help him win, Dr. Light temporarily installs him a variation of the Double Gear System.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls Mega Man in a 2D environment, as he runs through the levels and defeats evil robots. There are eight unique Robot Masters that serve as the game's bosses.\n\nThe Double Gear System not only sets up the game's plot but also works as a game mechanic. Using it, Mega Man can access two additional skills. The first is “Speed Gear” that allows him to slow the time down as if he moves and reacts incredibly fast. The other is “Power Gear” that allows Mega Man to make attacks that deal more damage. In accordance with the game's plot, however, the use of the Double Gear System is not safe and can overheat Mega Man.",
